![image](https://github.com/Tang-Li-Jen/T_Brain_Malware_Detection_Competition/blob/master/images/TM_wallpaper.PNG) 
This competition was held by **TrendMicro**, a well-known antivirus software company, on data science competition platform **T-Brain**. T-Brian is established in this year and attempts to create a competitive data science environment in Taiwan. It has planned to launch series of competitions in following days. If you get interested, look around this promising platform!
## Problem Statement
Malware detection is an crucial issue in the field of Cyber Security. Traditionally, they use malwares' specific signatures to detect, but it costs lots of time and computation resources. Therefore, TrendMicro attempts to rely on machine learning skill to detect malware in time and reduce costs.  
**Given the query log within three monthes, Build a predictive model to detect malware under the situation of file agnostic.**
## Dataset
1. Query Log  
  Query log contains 83,273,110 records of 81,977 unique FileID,including columns of FileID, CustomerID, ProductID and querytime.
2. Train
  Training dataset contains 52,559 unique FileID and their malware_or_not(Target value) tag.
3. Test  
  Tesing dataset contains 29,418 unique FileID.
## Timeline
Starts at: Jan 22 2018
